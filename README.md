# euripidean-urtext-retrodictor
This repository contains jupyter notebooks that I used for an LLM finetuning project that I did as an independent project for a Postgraduate Certificate in Digital Humanities through the University of Canterbury in 2024. The goal of the project was to complete fragments of Euripides' lost plays using LLM generated text. 

Also included are a report discussing my process and evaluating the results of the experiments, and an essay discussing the methodological implications of this technique for similar literary-history reconstruction problems.
